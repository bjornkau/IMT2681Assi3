This is NTNU IMT2681 project 3
this is a collabortaion between the students:
1: 470901
2: 470916

All main handling functionality is within main.go
database calls are handled by database.go
database_test.go contains all our tests

We've borrowed parts of the docker setup from 
the group containing Jonas J. Solsvik

We made the project from scratch, with the exeption of 
the database file, as we borrowed that from assi2
our main handler, takes a post request from Dialogflow, 
handles the request, by first looking up it's own database, 
and if there are no entries, asking fixer for the current rates
